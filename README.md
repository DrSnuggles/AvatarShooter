LD37 - ED:Avatar Shooter 

Story: 
Evil commanders are trying to bring UAs to our station = our room. You have to shoot them down, but take care not to hit one of us :-) 
Why this: 
I'm an Elite Dangerous gamer and i love this game like it's predecessors. 

Inspired by the view in front of my space ship, which i'm consuming too much, and ongoing war in galaxy i had the idea of killing our enemies in our station. 

Blue or red. You decide! Intended was that you shoot the red ones and get 200 points and a penalty of -500 if you hit a blue one. 
But, if you like you can try to make as much negative points as possible. 

I do a bit of coding around ED but this time i wanted to join LD and build this little, simple game 

I made it as simple as possible and we enjoy playing it. It just took about 6-8 hours. Most of the time was needed for searching avatars in youtube/forums/databases and resizing them. 

The code is commented but not very nice. Most of it is just copy&paste from MDN 

Used Tools: 
Programmers Notepad / Paint.NET / Audacity
